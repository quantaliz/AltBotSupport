AltBot is a friendly and helpful local chatbot assistant designed specifically for iOS & Mac users.

Unlike other chatbots that rely on external servers or internet connectivity, AltBot runs entirely locally on your device. This means local responses, improved privacy, and no dependence on the internet.
Whether you need assistance with simple tasks, bounce ideas, or just want to engage in friendly conversation, AltBot is here to help.

**NOTE** Line any other Large Language Model, it could provide innacurrate/misleading information. AltBot Lite uses mistral-7B language model as its baseline. AltBot uses the improved Llama-3.
